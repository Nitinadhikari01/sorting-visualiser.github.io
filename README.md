Welcome to visualizer-of-sorting!

It visualise the implementation of sorting algorithms:

1) Bubble sort
2) Selection sort
3) Insertion sort
4) Merge sort
5) Quick sort
6) Heap sort


I  build this web application using html,css and javascript.
It is a web application showcasing the inner workings of sorting algorithms.
Features of web application:
1. Colored representations(at the time of executing):
  a. Gray :- default
  b. Yellow :- Being compared
  c. Red :-  Incorrect position and to be moved
  d. Green :- Correct position

2. Controls for visualizations:-
  a) Speed of visualization (time delay as we slid left to right)
  b) Data size ()
  c) Randomly generate new data.

3. while processing it make a sound according to speed.
I hope that you enjoy playing around with this visualizer tool as much as I enjoyed building it.
